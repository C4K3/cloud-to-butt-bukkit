# Cloud-to-butt-bukkit

A very simple bukkit plugin that simply converts all instances in chat messages of *the cloud* into *my butt*, and *cloud* into *butt* (in that order, and case-sensitive.)

Compiling
-----
Requires a Java JDK, *make*, and a bukkit jar.

To compile, run `make` in the directory. To specify the bukkit jar and/or java version, run it as
```
make BUKKIT=/path/to/bukkit.jar JAVA=1.7
```
